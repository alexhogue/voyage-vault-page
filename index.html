          <p>The goal of the project was to design and build an interface for users to create their dream travel bucket list, share 
            their travel experiences, and explore others' travel opinions.</p>
          <p>The final product is a fully functional interactive interface that displays travel destinations to users, allows them to 
            sort and filter the options, and add their favorites to their "vault" which functions as an aggregator to display users' 
            selections "vault".</p>

      <h2>Preperation</h2>
      <p>I began the design process by analyzing and drawing comparisons between various existing interfaces that implement a favoriting
        feature in order to figure out the clearest and most effective way to implement my travel bucket list builder.

          <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
          <p>Below is a competitive comparison chart used to analyse the features of 3 interfaces with favoriting functions: Goodreads, Netflix, 
            and TripAdvisor.</p>

              <h3>Importance of visual layout</h3>
              <p>Based on the Competitive Comparison chart, it is clearly important that a favorite function be intuitive and clear to 
                users. This includes how the items are displayed visually on the interface. The aspects that were most successful between these 
                three interfaces include displaying many options to the user directly on the main page so that a user can scroll through the options 
                without having to click to other pages. Netflix and TripAdvisor do this, whereas Goodreads requires a user to click on a genre 
                before viewing all options. Forcing users to make choices can be less effective than letting them browse freely. All three sites employ a 
                similar visual structure that works effectively; a grided layout of options creates visual hierarchy and use of repeated 
                forms that clearly communicate their function and orient the user on the page. </p>
            </div>
            <div id="summarySec2">
              <h3>Importance of intuitive flow</h3>
              <p>Making the favorite action intuitive is equally important; TripAdvisor uses a simple heart icon, whereas Netflix 
                requires hover for the like option to appear, and Goodreads has numerous like/save/rating options that may be too 
                wordy and confusing for a user. Additionally, clear “unliking” is important to allow users flexibility to modify their 
                lists or rectify errors; Netflix does this very clearly by simply allowing users to click the like button again to 
                unlike it, whereas Goodreads and TripAdvisor require additional steps. All three sites provided the user with effective 
                feedback when liking items to communicate a user’s completed and successful action. </p>

          <div id="plans">
            <p>Based on my analysis, it is important to implement the following factors in my own design to optimize the user 
              experience with the interface:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Clear layout with all options viewable on the home page</li>
              <li>Allow sorting by category</li>
              <li>Limit excess wordiness</li>
              <li>Use clear icons for liking items without extra clicks needed</li>

          <h3>Planning</h3>
          <p>I began by planning out my design using Figma with a focus on clarity and accessibility.</p>
          <p>Using the information gleaned from my competitive comparison, I took the elements from the three interfaces
            that were most effective, and revised elements that were less effective.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="analysis">

            <h4><b>Layout</b></h4>
            <p>The purpose of the app is to provide users with travel destination ideas and allow them to build their travel bucket 
              list and view other users opinions and rankings. It is that the travel information for each destination be
              clearly layed out into item cards for users to easily browse.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="choices">
              <h4><b>Sort and Filter</b></h4>
              <p>Because travel is incredibly distinct to each individual's 
              preferences, sorting and filtering the options is extremely useful. I created the options for users to sort by most liked destinations 
              and filter destinations by both continent as well as desired activity (e.g city, beach, and adventure focused destinations).</p>
            </div>
            <div id="choices">
              <h4><b>Aggregator</b></h4>
              <p>The user is then able to add their favorite destinations to their travel vault. The vault is the aggregator that displays the users choices 
              in a section to the left of the travel grid so that users can easily view and update their list as they browse.</p>

    <div id="conclusion">
      <h2>Reflections</h2>
      <p>With this project, I learned a lot about designing and building an intuitive and functional interactive interface. I 
        refined my skills in programming with React to implement my UI design after completing the UI/UX research and design process. I
        also learned about the considerations and intericacies that go into building an interface at both a the design stage
        as well as the implementation stage; both require clear planning in order to figure out the best way to acheive the project's
        goal. I look forward to continuing to develop my design and front-end programming skills. </p>

        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <p><b>Clear and Accessible Layout:</b> Providing a clear layout with all options readily viewable enhances usability and allows users to 
          easily navigate and interact with the interface.</p>
        <p><b>Simplified Interaction:</b> Using clear icons and limiting excess wordiness helps streamline user interactions and reduces 
          cognitive load, resulting in a more efficient and enjoyable user experience.</p>
        <p><b>Flexibility and Feedback:</b> Offering options for sorting, favoriting, and removing items, along with clear feedback 
          mechanisms, empowers users to customize their experience and provides valuable feedback on their actions.</p>
